Hi, I’m Jasmine!
I'm currently a Masters student in Data Science and Analytics, with a passiong of exploring the multi-faceted
usage of data and how it can be streamlined into meaningful actions and results.

I mainly work with Python and its libraries, and previously dabbled with SQL and R.

My current study strengthens my skills in Machine Learning, Algorithms, and Big Data; building on top of
previous skills in Artificial Intelligence.

Currently, I'm learning:
○ Hadoop!
○ More SQL!
○ More Machine Learning!
○ Mathematics behind algorithms!
