☁︎ Hi, I’m Jasmine! ᵔᴗᵔ

I'm currently a Masters student in Data Science and Analytics, with a passion of exploring the multi-faceted
usage of data and how it can be streamlined into meaningful actions and results.

I mainly work with Python and its libraries, and previously dabbled with SQL and R for working with Big Data.

My current study strengthens my skills in Machine Learning, Algorithms, and Big Data; building on top of
previous skills in Artificial Intelligence.

Currently, I'm learning:

• NLP!

• Deep Learning (NNs)!

• More Machine Learning!

Previously, I've dabbled in:
- mathematics behind algorithms
- SQL
- machine learning

Outside of school, you can find me dabbling with art (drawing) or curating a new music playlist to listen to
for late night coding sessions!
